Businesses that actually care about turning a profit will spend a lot of time (hence, a lot of engineers) working on optimizing systems, even if an MVP for the system could have been built in a weekend.
This reminds me of a common fallacy we see in unreliable systems, where people build the happy path with the idea that the happy path is the “real” work, and that error handling can be tacked on later.</description></item><item><title>the-ones-who-walk-from-omelas</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/articles/the-ones-who-walk-from-omelas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2021 09:14:10 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/articles/the-ones-who-walk-from-omelas/</guid><description>http://sites.asiasociety.org/asia21summit/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/3.-Le-Guin-Ursula-The-Ones-Who-Walk-Away-From-Omelas.pdf
There is no happiness without suffering. The story presents a classic utilitarian problem: is it morally justifiable to inflict suffering on one person in the service of others’ happiness?
Thinking about it in terms of technology as a multiplicative tool. Is it then morally just to develop technology to benefit others knowing that it will exacerbate the suffering of marginalized groups?

An identity-based social graph is fundamentally limited. Your Facebook identity and social graph are mere digital shadows of their physical counterparts, and little more.
By attaching our real-world identities to everything we do, these platforms feel suffocating and unsafe. Is there any way we can construct fully virtual worlds not tethered to reality? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure we can.

Mostly about maintenance of cities and parallels with maintaining software.
urban-planning Brand argues that many great buildings achieved their greatness by gradual stepwise evolution over time. New buildings need to be designed with the expectation that they will evolve, because they usually outlive their initial use. Even if a building does not change its use (e.g. it remains the same university department), the needs of its users will change and the building will need to adapt.</description></item><item><title>Project Idea List</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/project-list/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 00:33:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/project-list/</guid><description>DreamCoder boolsat https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem

Why trees instead of graphs Both the tree and the semilattice are ways of thinking about how a large collection of many small systems goes to make up a large and complex system. More generally, they are both names for structures of sets.
For the human mind, the tree is the easiest vehicle for complex thoughts. But the city is not, cannot and must not be a tree. The city is a receptacle for life.</description></item><item><title>Building in Public</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/building-in-public/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2021 17:39:37 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/building-in-public/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.&amp;rdquo; — richard hamming

The DKR is a wonderful example of the kind of investment that you can start making at the C level, with modest means, that will pay dividends back as it moves up the line to the B and the A levels.</description></item><item><title>A request for coffee chats</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/newsletters/issue-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 13:43:34 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/newsletters/issue-1/</guid><description>This month of January went by with blazing speed.

Surviving, in this case, is a questionable word choice.

A gardener tenderly shovels and removes unwanted weeds and pours water to nourish the plants he wants to grow. He takes care to make sure the soil isn&amp;rsquo;t too wet and that each plant has ample space to grow. When the time comes, he harvests each fruit and vegetable and makes sure to plant seeds so that he can repeat the process anew in a few weeks time.</description></item><item><title>Hello world!</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/newsletters/issue-0/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 13:43:34 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/newsletters/issue-0/</guid><description>Hi there and thanks for signing up for my newsletter!

Introduction Historically, development of AI has taken a very specific approach — systems that represent the world through symbols and manipulate those tokens in a systematic way to arrive at a result. This type of AI was coined Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI) by John Haugeland1.</description></item><item><title>On AI’s ‘Bias Bug’</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/posts/bias-bug/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Aug 2020 16:27:50 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/posts/bias-bug/</guid><description>This blog post was originally intended to be a TED Talk given at TEDxRedmond but I unfortunately was never accepted.

Check out the repository for example code!
Introduction What is Docker? Docker is a tool that makes it really easy to package applications into self-sustaining &amp;lsquo;containers&amp;rsquo;.
What are containers? Containers, as their name suggests, contain things. In the case of Docker, these contain all the parts the application needs to run, everything from libraries and dependencies to the actual source code.
Why containers? Containerization means that everything to do with your application stays inside the container.</description></item><item><title>reflect: NLP Model Explained</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/posts/reflect/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 08:51:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/posts/reflect/</guid><description>How do we tell that this is a “valid” intent?
A (not so) brief exploration of how we tackle classifying intents in reflect. Part 1 will touch on defining the problem we’re trying to solve, the data we have, and how we pre-processed it. Part 2 will focus on the architecture of the model we built, how well it does, and thoughts on improving it for the future.
The problem Classifying intents is at the core of reflect.</description></item><item><title>DSCI 100</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/classes/dsci-100/textbook/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 00:00:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/classes/dsci-100/textbook/</guid><description>Textbook Notes classification → i.e., predicting a categorical class (sometimes called a label) for an observation given its other quantitative variables (sometimes called features).
“training set”: because we use these observations to train, or teach, our classifier so that we can use it to make predictions on new data that we have not seen previously.
class imbalance → when one label is much more common than another. For the present purposes, it will suffice to rebalance the data by oversampling the rare class.</description></item><item><title>Interning at Hootsuite in Highschool</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/posts/hootsuite/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2019 08:51:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/posts/hootsuite/</guid><description>(with insights from Calvin and Hobbes)
