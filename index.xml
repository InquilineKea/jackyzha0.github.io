Mostly about maintenance of cities and parallels with maintaining software.
urban-planning Brand argues that many great buildings achieved their greatness by gradual stepwise evolution over time. New buildings need to be designed with the expectation that they will evolve, because they usually outlive their initial use. Even if a building does not change its use (e.g. it remains the same university department), the needs of its users will change and the building will need to adapt.</description></item><item><title>Project Idea List</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/project-list/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 00:33:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/project-list/</guid><description>Finished reflect ctrl-v portal Ideas DreamCoder boolsat https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem

Why trees instead of graphs Both the tree and the semilattice are ways of thinking about how a large collection of many small systems goes to make up a large and complex system. More generally, they are both names for structures of sets.
For the human mind, the tree is the easiest vehicle for complex thoughts. But the city is not, cannot and must not be a tree. The city is a receptacle for life.</description></item><item><title>Building in Public</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/building-in-public/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2021 17:39:37 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/building-in-public/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.&amp;rdquo; — richard hamming
