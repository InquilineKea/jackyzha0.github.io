“training set”: because we use these observations to train, or teach, our classifier so that we can use it to make predictions on new data that we have not seen previously.
class imbalance → when one label is much more common than another. For the present purposes, it will suffice to rebalance the data by oversampling the rare class.</description></item></channel></rss>
